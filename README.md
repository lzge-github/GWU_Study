### Project 1 _PUBH6860 Principles of Bioinformatics_
### **Exploration of the kinship among the five classes of vertebrates by analyzing the phylogeny of hemoglobin**

We will use the nucleotide sequences of the five classes (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds) of vertebrates involved to analyze the phylogenetic relationship. We plan to pick 10 species of each class. Related 3D figures will also be obtained.
